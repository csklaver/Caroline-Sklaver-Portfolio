### *Feature Engineering and Missing Value Imputation Methods for Classification of Depression with Deep Neural Networks*
[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://csklaver.github.io/)
This project explores missing value imputation methods, resampling techniques, feature engineering, and neural networks to predicting depression using NHANES data from 2005 to 2016. Statistical and machine learning imputation methods along with feature engineering techniques can improve classification results of both a deep ANN (DANN) and a multi-layer CNN. NHANES data is highly imbalanced with respect to depression (7.49% positive class) and contains many missing values. The primary goal of this project is to identify the best imputation and feature engineering methods to optimize classification ability of these DNNs with the challenges of a highly imbalanced dataset and a target disease with imprecise causes.

## Data Mining Final Project
### [*Analysis of London Bike Share Usage - A Graphical User Interface*](https://github.com/csklaver/Data-Mining_GUI-Analysis)
The purpose of this project is to perform EDA and machine learning algorithms to predict 2015 London bike share activity. This project includes python script to preprocess and export the cleaned data, as well as create visualizations for our final presentation. We also include a GUI portion for users to run through EDA, Linear Regressions, and Multiple Linear Regressions with this dataset.
