[Exploratory Data Analysis & Trends](https://csklaver.github.io/)

This project explores missing value imputation methods, resampling techniques, feature engineering, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict depression using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2005 to 2016. NHANES data is highly imbalanced with respect to depression (7.49% positive class) and contains many missing values. The primary goal of this project is to identify the best imputation and feature engineering methods to optimize classification ability of deep ANNs with the challenges of this highly imbalanced dataset and a target disease with complex causes. Progressive machine learning imputation along with feature engineering techniques were proven to enhance classification results of a multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) by 10% measured by F1-Scores.

## [Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/csklaver/ML_Kiva_Crowdfunding)
### *Kiva Crowdfunding: A Machine Learning Analysis*
> Google Colab, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn 

The aim of this project is to apply machine learning methods to gain insight into how Kiva determines the amount (USD - Regression) and repayment interval type (monthly, bullet, or irregular - Classification) of loans in Latin America. To achieve these goals we preprocessed and cleaned the data, performed exploratory data analyses, split the data into training and testing, implemented multiple machine learning algorithms, and fine-tune the hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. In classifying repayment interval, we achieved an F1-score of 0.874 with Histogram Gradient Boosting, followed by Random Forest and MLPC. According to our Random Forest Classifier, the top 5 features given in order of importance were: Loan Term (months), Country Colombia, Loan Amount, Agriculture and Livestock Activity, and Multidimensional Poverty Index. In all, our regression models predicting loan amount were weak, thus we cannot make conclusions about the features with respect to loan amount. On the other hand, our classification models were quite accurate in predicting repayment interval type, which may be useful in determining what a borrowers repayment interval should be, given all other factors.

### *Analysis of London Bike Share Usage: A Graphical User Interface (GUI)*
> PyCharm, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyQt5, Matplotlib, Seaborn

The purpose of this project is to perform EDA and regression analysis to predict 2015 London bike share activity. This project includes python script to preprocess and export the cleaned data, as well as create visualizations for our final presentation. These visualizations are presented in GUI for users to chose variables to include in Correlation matricies, Linear Regressions, and Multiple Linear Regressions with this dataset.

## [Natural Language Processing Project](https://github.com/csklaver/NLP_The-2020-Presidential-Race)
### *The 2020 Presidential Race: NLP and Sentiment Analysis of Online News Articles*
> Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NLTK, SpaCy, Genism, Textacy, scikit-learn

The aim of this project was to determine the sentiment of top online news outlets towards the top three presidential candidates, Trump, Biden, and Sanders. Pre-processed text by tokenizing, lemmatizing, and removing stop words. Examined term frequenices and TF-IDF scores for each candidate and each news outlet. Lastly, we developed and evaluated SVM and XGBoost classification models with varying weights (binary word count, term frequency, and TF-IDF score) and n-grams (unigram, bigram, and trigram). The best configuration was achieved using SVM using unigrams and TF-IDF scores as weights.

## [Network Data Science Project](https://github.com/csklaver/network_science_flights) 
### *Making Connections: An Analysis of US Commercial Aviation Networks*
> RStudio, dplyr, igraph, ggplot2

Explored and analyzed the US commercial airline transportation networks from 1998 to 2018 measured by betweenness, centrality, diameter, and degree. Created maps and vizualizations of the network nodes and edges. Conducted a case study of Southwest Airlines and Delta which revealed the differences in growth strategies; Southwest focusing on including more airports increasing betweenness and Delta focusing on growing degree of major hubs. Lastly, we found the total network to be robust when removing 20 major hubs (in the case of COVID-19), but unable to handle the same volume of passengers.

### *Top Country Health, Education, and Military Spending: A Visual Analysis*
> HTML, CSS, JS, Google API Charts

This projet explores the healthcare, education, and military spending of some of the top countries in the world. This includes 15 of the G-20 countries from 2013 to 2018. Utilizing Google API Charts, I explore trends over time and compare spending across top countries.<br/>

### *The Major Factors Driving Global Antibiotic Consumption: A Quantitative Analysis of the Leading Determinants from 2000 to 2015*
> RStudio, stats, ggbiplot, ggplot2, plotly, stargazer

The goal of this project is to identify the socio-economic and cultural factors driving global antibiotic consumption. Data on total antibiotic consumption and consumption by class was provided by the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, while most other variables were obtained from the World Development Indicators in the World Bank Databank. To analyze the data, I used principle component analysis biplots, variance inflation factors, and multiple linear regressions. In low- and middle-income countries, the use of basic sanitation facilities and the density of pharmaceutical personnel were found to have significant negative correlations to antibiotic consumption across classes. In high-income countries, the use of basic sanitation facilities, the density of pharmaceutical personnel, and primary school completion rates were found to have significant positive correlations to antibiotic consumption across classes.
